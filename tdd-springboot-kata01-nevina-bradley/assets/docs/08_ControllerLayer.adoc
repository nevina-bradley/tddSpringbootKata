= Spring Boot - The Controller Layer

Building the controller layer and its unit tests

== The Controller Layer
The controller layer breaks down the incoming HTTP request and makes the necessary calls to the
service layers, acts as a layer marshalling and unmarshalling the request/response objects
from/to JSON.

The controller layer also pads the relevant metadata as a part of building out a response.

The controller package has an interface and an implementation. The interface is covered in more
detail in a subsequent chapter.

```
src
└── main
    └── java
        └── com
            └── codedifferently
                └── phonebook
                    └── widgets
                        └── controllers
                            └── WidgetController.java
```

.. The controller implementation is marked with a `@RestController` stereotype.
.. The class has a `@RequestMapping` annotation which provides a context path for the web URLs.
.. The `constructor` autowires a `WidgetService` interface which is made available via a Spring
context.
.. The Controller Implementation validates the request body upon invocation and also creates the
response body to return the desired content.
.. The metadata information is baked into the responses built out from the service calls.

== The Controller unit test

```
src
└── test
    └── java
        └── com
            └── codedifferently
                └── phonebook
                    └── widgets
                        └── controllers
                            └── WidgetControllerTest.java
```
The controller is tested with @SpringBootTest.

. Test extending the abstract test setup +
⇒ `WidgetControllerTest`
.. This test extends from the *abstract* test class which adds a *mock* implementation of the
`WidgetService` with a `@MockBean` annotation.
.. The `@MockBean` is a mockito utility present in the `spring-boot-test.jar` that injects a bean
into the Spring context after adding some mock responses.

. Abstract mock setup +
```
src
└── test
    └── java
        └── com
            └── codedifferently
                └── phonebook
                    └── BaseControllerTest.java

```
⇒ `BaseControllerTest.java`

.. Abstract mock class (re-used in other tests)

```

. Create the responses and controller layers and appropriate unit tests.
.. Cover the basic HTTP Error code responses shown in the sample.
. The following controller APIs should be created:
.. All CRUD related calls
.. Find By lastName, should return a list.
